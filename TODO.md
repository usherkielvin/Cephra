# OTP Fix Plan

## Steps to Fix OTP Storage Issue

1. **Check for Scheduled Cleanup** - Already done via search_files, no cron jobs found.
2. **Set Correct Timezone in PHP** - Add timezone setting to Appweb/User/api/forgot_password.php.
3. **Temporarily Disable OTP Cleanup** - Comment out cleanup calls in test_otp_cleanup.php and Appweb/User/api/forgot_password_updated.php.
4. **Update Database Connection for Timezone** - Modify Appweb/User/config/database.php to set PDO timezone.
5. **Test OTP Storage** - Run a test to generate and store OTP.
6. **Verify Expiration Logic** - Check if expiration works correctly.
