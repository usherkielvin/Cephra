# Wallet Page Design Improvements

## Overview
Enhancing the visual design of `Appweb/User/wallet.php` to make it more modern while preserving the color scheme (#00c2ce primary, #0e3a49 dark, light backgrounds). Focus on increasing width utilization, adding details (icons, animations, shadows), and ensuring responsiveness. No functional changes to PHP/JS.

## Breakdown of Steps
1. **Increase max-width for better width utilization**:
   - Update `.container` max-width from 1200px to 1400px.
   - Adjust `.trans-list` from 800px to 1000px.
   - Ensure responsive breakpoints handle larger widths gracefully.

2. **Enhance balance card**:
   - Add inner glow (box-shadow with primary color).
   - Add decorative gradient border.
   - Animate balance text with a subtle pulse on load.

3. **Improve transactions section**:
   - Add Font Awesome icons (e.g., fa-plus for deposits, fa-minus for withdrawals) next to descriptions.
   - Add alternating striped backgrounds for items.
   - Enhance hover effects (scale + color shift).

4. **Hero section enhancements**:
   - Add floating geometric shapes via CSS pseudo-elements.
   - Add fade-in animation for greeting.

5. **Buttons and modal improvements**:
   - Add ripple effect on button clicks.
   - Smooth scale-in animation for modal.
   - Improve focus states with primary color outlines.

6. **General enhancements**:
   - Add fade-in animations for sections using existing keyframes.
   - Improve typography (bolder weights, letter-spacing).
   - Add subtle dividers and enhanced drop shadows.

7. **Verification**:
   - Test rendering and interactions.
   - Update TODO.md with completion status.
