# Cephra Dashboard Enhancement TODO

## Current Work
Updating the user dashboard (Appweb/User/dashboard.php) for better EV charging features, UI improvements, and live status integration. Recent edit to dashboard.php confirmed successful with no functional changes needed.

## Key Technical Concepts
- PHP for session management and database queries (PDO).
- HTML5 with embedded PHP for dynamic vehicle data.
- CSS custom styles for white theme, responsive grid layouts, animations.
- JavaScript/jQuery for modals, API fetches (live status from api/mobile.php or admin API), i18n, mobile menu.
- Integration with database for user/vehicle info.

## Relevant Files and Code
- Appweb/User/dashboard.php: Main dashboard file with PHP logic, HTML structure, inline CSS, JS scripts. Key sections: session check, vehicle data fetch, hero/live status/features sections, modals/JS functions.
  - Recent change: Full content replacement (no-op, confirmed identical).
- Appweb/User/css/vantage-style.css: External stylesheet (open tab); may need review for theme consistency.
- config/database.php: Database connection (required in dashboard.php).

## Problem Solving
- Ensured session security and vehicle data display based on car_index.
- Fixed potential indentation/formatting via edit (verified correct).
- Live status fetches from API with fallback; no errors reported.

## Pending Tasks and Next Steps
1. [x] Review and edit dashboard.php for content accuracy and indentation. (Completed: Successful save, diff verified.)
2. [] Sync CSS updates in vantage-style.css if inline styles conflict. (Next: Use read_file on css/vantage-style.css to check, then edit if needed.)
3. [] Implement/test missing modals (e.g., stationsModal, scheduleModal) in JS. (Quote from recent conversation: "Add click handlers for modal triggers" â€“ verify and add if absent.)
4. [] Enhance live status updates: Ensure fetchAndRenderLiveStatus works across devices. (Test via browser_action if needed.)
5. [] Verify full i18n translation on load. (Call translateDashboard() confirmed in JS.)
6. [] Test mobile responsiveness and animations. (Use browser_action to launch and scroll/resize.)
7. [] Final verification: Run site and confirm all features (vehicle status, rewards popup, etc.).

After completing steps, update this file and proceed to attempt_completion.
